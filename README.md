# Udacity Machine Learning Nano Degree Projects
This repository hold all the projects done as part of Udacity's Machine Learning Nano Degree program. 

**Project 1 - Sentiment Analysis**
The first project is about creating a web app inorder to determine the sentiment of a movie review using the IMDB data set. Amazon's SageMaker service is used to construct a random tree model to predict the sentiment of a movie review. In addition, this model will be deployed to an endpoint and a very simple web app will be constructed which will interact with our model's deployed endpoint.

**Project 2 - Plagarism Detector**
This project is about building a plagiarism detector that examines a text file and performs binary classification; labeling that file as either plagiarized or not, depending on how similar that text file is to a provided source text. Detecting plagiarism is an active area of research; the task is non-trivial and the differences between paraphrased answers and original work are often not so obvious.

**Capstone Project and Proposal**
The project I chose is the dog breed classifier using CNN and transfer learning in PyTorch. This project is to classify the different dog breeds using CNN (created from scratch) and transfer learning in PyTorch.
