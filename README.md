# Udacity Machine Learning Nano Degree Projects
This repository hold all the projects done as part of Udacity's Machine Learning Nano Degree program. 

The first project is about creating a web app inorder to determine the sentiment of a movie review using the IMDB data set. Amazon's SageMaker service is used to construct a random tree model to predict the sentiment of a movie review. In addition, this model will be deployed to an endpoint and a very simple web app will be constructed which will interact with our model's deployed endpoint.
